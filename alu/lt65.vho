-- The following code must appear in the VHDL architecture header:

------------- Begin Cut here for COMPONENT Declaration ------ COMP_TAG
component lt65
	port (
	a: IN std_logic_VECTOR(64 downto 0);
	b: IN std_logic_VECTOR(64 downto 0);

-- Synplicity black box declaration
attribute syn_black_box : boolean;
attribute syn_black_box of lt65: component is true;

-- COMP_TAG_END ------ End COMPONENT Declaration ------------

-- The following code must appear in the VHDL architecture
-- body. Substitute your own instance name and net names.

------------- Begin Cut here for INSTANTIATION Template ----- INST_TAG
your_instance_name : lt65
		port map (
			a => a,
			b => b,

-- You must compile the wrapper file lt65.vhd when simulating

-- reference the XilinxCoreLib VHDL simulation library. For detailed
-- instructions, please refer to the "CORE Generator Help".
